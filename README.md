Driver Distraction Detection- 
I developed a program that sends an alert once the driver:
With mediapipe face recognition model:
moves his head to the sides / up / down 
Eyes closed (using Eyes Aspect Ratio) 

is on the phone (Search for a phone objective (YOLO))

Saving the time stamp + the offense made as a log in a txt file 
Each time the program starts --> create a new txt file
+
Taking a picture (saving a frame) from the moment you took your eyes off the road !!

To be continued..
